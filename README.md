# Challenges encountred and solutions

First challenge that encountred me was during the Sorting Products, the assertion in the for loop failed due to the '$' present in the number. So I made the function that converts the string into a number and replaces the '$' with ''. 


The next challenge that encountred me was in the View Cart Content, I wanted to reuse my 'addingProductsToCart function but that function returns void and can't be used in the array I wanted to make. So I made another function with a string return type to be able to insert the values in an array and compare it with the expected items.


The next challenge I encountred was with the Empty Cart Checkout, I wanted to find a way to assert that the cart is actually empty, until I found the locator to assert with that the count of items is equal to 0.
